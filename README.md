## 10.10 LAB: Currency Conversion (jQuery)
- This was difficult possibly because it was the first project right after the activities. A lot of it was syntax difficulties. Starting off I ran into the problem of `for ... of` vs `for ... in` when trying to find names for the currency abbervations. `of` is more used for arrays while `for... in` is used for objects which returns the keys of the object. Also `val()` and `text()` helped me learn that `val()` is used for input usually and `text()` returns the text of an element when updating the results. 

### Takeaways
- Practiced event listeners `.on` and the different kinds of events that trigger them. 
- `append` elements onto other elements. 
- Overall saw the similarities of using regular javascript and jquery.
